           <h2>Hi, I’m Badri and I’m a software engineer.</h2>
        <p class="body-par">
            I am a software engineer currently enrolled in Thinkful’s Engineering Immersion bootcamp. 
        I love coding because of the feeling you get when you finally get your code to work the way 
        it should after hours of working at it. It’s a lot like skateboarding to me-- you can try
        to land a kickflip for hours and hours, falling down and messing up along the way, but that 
        feeling you get when you land your trick, super dope. 

        I geek out on anything tech. I fancy finding out about how things do the things they do. I am 
        becoming increasingly interested in the capabilities of AI and Machine Learning and have an 
        interest in Blockchains and cryptocurrencies as well. 

        When I’m not at home on my computer, I’m usually at the beach, skating, swimming, or surfing.
        I like to try to stay as active as possible and always keep moving.

            Projects: 
            1) Quiz App <br>
            The Quiz App is an app developed by Phoebe Law and myself. It is to test the parents of
            bootcamp students on their knowledge on their child's bootcamp.
            The Quiz App was made using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and jQuery. <br>
